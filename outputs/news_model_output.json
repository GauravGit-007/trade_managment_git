As countries redirect exports away from the United States, falling import prices may help lower domestic inflation, Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) Chief Economist Paul Conway said in a speech at Business New Zealand.  \"There's a whole lot of 'wait and see' going on out there right now,\" Conway said.",

MUMBAI (Reuters) -India's rupee plunged toward a record low and equity indexes declined on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump slapped steeper-than-expected tariffs on Indian goods, with analysts warning of sustained pressure on the country's growth.  The 25% tariffs announced could shave off the South Asian nation's growth in 2025-26 by up to 40 basis points, with the threat of additional penalties further clouding the outlook, economists said.  India's benchmark equity indices, the Nifty 50 and BSE Sensex, fell about 0.6% each, while the rupee declined to an over five-month low of 87.74 before paring losses amid likely dollar-selling intervention by the central bank.",
