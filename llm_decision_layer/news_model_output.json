As countries redirect exports away from the United States, falling import prices may help lower domestic inflation, Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) Chief Economist Paul Conway said in a speech at Business New Zealand.  \"There's a whole lot of 'wait and see' going on out there right now,\" Conway said.",

MUMBAI (Reuters) -India's rupee plunged toward a record low and equity indexes declined on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump slapped steeper-than-expected tariffs on Indian goods, with analysts warning of sustained pressure on the country's growth.  The 25% tariffs announced could shave off the South Asian nation's growth in 2025-26 by up to 40 basis points, with the threat of additional penalties further clouding the outlook, economists said.  India's benchmark equity indices, the Nifty 50 and BSE Sensex, fell about 0.6% each, while the rupee declined to an over five-month low of 87.74 before paring losses amid likely dollar-selling intervention by the central bank.",

JACKSON HOLE, Wyoming (Reuters) -U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech to the annual Jackson Hole economic conference on Friday comes amid unprecedented pressure on the central bank from President Donald Trump, but mixed economic data may pull Powell toward a middle ground that leaves major questions unresolved.  Investors are expecting and Trump is demanding a rate cut when the Fed meets next month, and two Fed governors began pushing for cuts with dissents at the central bank's last policy meeting on concerns the labor market may be weakening faster than headline employment data suggests.  But inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target and is expected to move higher as the cost of Trump's import tariffs works its way into retail prices, a reason for caution in lowering rates during a price-adjustment process some policymakers feel may last into next year.",

    "text": "A US tariff exemption for small orders ends Friday. It's a big deal to some shoppers and businesses. Low-value imports are losing their duty-free status in the United States this week as part of President Donald Trump's agenda for making the nation less dependent on foreign goods and resetting global trade with tariffs.  An executive order signed last month eliminates a widely used customs exemption for international shipments worth $800 or less starting Friday, nearly two years earlier than the deadline set in the tax cuts and spending bill approved by Congress.  Although the president previously ended the \u201cde minimis\u201d rule for inexpensive items sent from China and Hong Kong, having to pay import taxes on small parcels from everywhere else likely will be a big change for some small businesses and online shoppers.",
